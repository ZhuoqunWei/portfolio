        <p><strong>Hey! Iâ€™m Maggie Song, and welcome to my personal gallery. I love traveling and capturing photography along the way. Recently, I explored video art, which introduced me to the world of cinematics. Both photography and film have become important outlets for my creative expression, and I hope you can experience the color, tenderness, and variety I see through my lens. I will continue to update this portfolio, and I hope you enjoy the journey!</strong></p>
